# Migrating Docling to Rust — docling.rs

A port of [docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling) from Python to
Rust. This document is the **current status**: what is migrated, how it compares
to upstream docling, and what is intentionally not done yet. (The original
phased plan is kept at the end as history.)

> **Status: the format migration is complete.** Every document format in
> docling's pipeline is supported — including **audio/ASR** (Whisper via ONNX,
> in `docling-asr`) — plus Markdown (legacy + a Rust-only *strict* mode),
> docling-native **JSON** output, **DocLang (`.dclx`)** output (docling 2.110's
> OPC archive), **image extraction**, and **MHTML** (a
> docling.rs-only extension docling doesn't have). The declarative formats are pure-Rust and checked byte-for-byte
> against *live* docling; the PDF/image/METS ML path lives in `docling-pdf`
> (a pure-Rust PDF text parser + pdfium rasterization + ONNX
> layout/TableFormer/OCR + a port of docling-parse's line sanitizer) and is also
> measured byte-for-byte against live docling — **5 / 14 PDF fixtures exact, 6 / 14
> whitespace-normalized** (see `PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`), with a snapshot baseline
> guarding against regressions. `cargo test` is green (unit tests + a 133-source
> output-regression suite).

**At a glance** (for a first-time reader from the docling side):

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | A Rust port of docling's converter, backends, and discriminative PDF/ASR pipelines; same `convert → DoclingDocument → export_to_markdown()/json()` shape, single static binary, no Python/torch at runtime |
| **Conformance** | Declarative formats byte-for-byte vs *live* PyPI docling (most 100%, see §2); `.dclx` DocLang output ≈91% mean vs docling's own `.dclx` (§2); PDF ML path 5/14 fixtures byte-exact, rest close; every optimization is gated on this not regressing |
| **Performance** | PDF ML pipeline **4.3× faster warm / 4.7× end-to-end** than Python docling at 2.3–2.6× less peak RAM (INT8 + SIMD, conformance-validated); declarative formats 20–60× warm, ~60× less RAM; details + methodology in [`PDF_PERFORMANCE.md`](./PDF_PERFORMANCE.md) |
| **Models** | docling's own checkpoints (layout heron, TableFormer, PP-OCRv3, Whisper tiny), format-converted to ONNX by `scripts/export_*.py` — no retraining; INT8 variants are calibrated post-training quantizations (`scripts/install/quantize_models.py`) |
| **Tracking upstream** | See [§9](#9-keeping-up-with-upstream-docling): conformance is measured against the *latest published* docling on demand, so an upstream release that changes output surfaces as a concrete per-fixture diff |
| **Not ported (by design)** | VLM pipelines, enrichment models, DocTags/DocLang *input* backends (§5); inline formatting is baked into text rather than structured fields (§4) |

## 1. Architecture

The layers mirror docling's:

| Layer | docling (Python) | `docling.rs` (Rust) |
|---|---|---|
| **Data model + serializers** | `docling-core` | `docling-core` — `DoclingDocument`, the `Node` tree, Markdown + JSON serializers, base64 |
| **Converter** | `docling/document_converter.py` | `docling.rs` — `converter.rs` (format dispatch + XML content sniffing) |
| **Backends** | `docling/backend/*` | `docling.rs` — `backend/*` (one per format) |
| **PDF/ML pipeline** | `docling/pipeline/*`, `docling/models/*` | `docling-pdf` — pdfium + ONNX layout/OCR + assembly |
| **Audio/ASR pipeline** | `docling/pipeline/asr_pipeline.py` | `docling-asr` — symphonia decode + log-mel + ONNX Whisper |
| **CLI** | `docling/cli` | `docling-cli` |

```text
crates/
├── docling-core/   # DoclingDocument, Node model, markdown.rs, json.rs, base64.rs, labels.rs
├── docling.rs/        # DocumentConverter, source/format detection, backend/*.rs, ooxml.rs
├── docling-pdf/    # pdfium_backend, layout (RT-DETR/ONNX), ocr (PP-OCRv3/ONNX), assemble, mets
├── docling-asr/    # audio decode (symphonia), mel.rs, whisper.rs (ONNX), tokenizer.rs

└── docling-rag/    # RAG layer on top of the converter (chunking, embeddings, vector search, REST API)
```

The public API is unchanged from day one:

```rust
use docling::{DocumentConverter, SourceDocument};

let result = DocumentConverter::new()
    .convert(SourceDocument::from_file("input.docx")?)?;
println!("{}", result.document.export_to_markdown());   // or .export_to_json()
```

---

## 2. Format coverage

Conformance is measured against the latest **published** docling (installed from
PyPI; run via `scripts/conformance/conformance.sh <fmt>`), not the committed groundtruth
`.md` (which predates docling-core's current table serializer — see §4).
"Exact" = byte-for-byte.

### Declarative formats — pure Rust, no models

| Format | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown | `markdown.rs` (pulldown-cmark) | **10/10 exact** |
| CSV | `csv.rs` (`csv` crate) | **9/9 exact** |
| HTML | `html.rs` (scraper/html5ever) | **31/32 exact** (the last needs the page's external CSS at render time — §5) |
| AsciiDoc | `asciidoc.rs` (regex) | **4/4 exact** |
| DeepSeek-OCR Markdown | `deepseek.rs` | **3/3 exact** (auto-detected VLM-token variant) |
| XLSX | `xlsx.rs` (calamine) | **9/9 exact** (incl. chart captions/classification/data grids) |
| PPTX | `pptx.rs` (roxmltree) | **7/7 exact** |
| DOCX | `docx.rs` (roxmltree) | **26/26 exact** |
| WebVTT | `webvtt.rs` | **4/4 exact** |
| Email (.eml) | `email.rs` (mail-parser) | **2/2 exact** |
| EPUB | `epub.rs` → HTML backend | **0/1** — the single fixture is 39 diff lines (heading-italic nesting + colophon inline-link layout, the HTML inline residual) |
| ODF (odt/ods/odp) | `odf.rs` | **2/6 exact** on the native files (`.ods` table + `text_document_01`; `text_document_03` within 2 lines); presentations/frames — §5 |
| JATS | `jats.rs` (roxmltree) | **3/4 exact**; the eLife plain-text route diverges (252 diff lines) |
| USPTO | `uspto.rs` | **1/5 exact (2/5 whitespace-normalized)** on the sources live docling converts — it errors on the other 5 (those are validated byte-exact via `.dclx`), and its APS-text *Markdown* export is empty where ours emits the text dump (the `.dclx` matches exactly — §5) |
| XBRL | `xbrl.rs` | arelle-free core (dei facts → title, `*TextBlock` → HTML); *vs committed groundtruth* 0/2 (30 / 346 diff lines) — live docling needs arelle, which the conformance venv doesn't ship |
| JSON-docling | `docling_json.rs` (serde_json) | reads docling's native JSON; ~51/145 round-trip exact |
| LaTeX | `latex.rs` (scanner) | simple `.tex` ≈ live (0/2 exact, but within 2 / 9 diff lines); multi-file arxiv out of scope |
| MHTML (.mhtml/.mht) | `mhtml.rs` (mail-parser) → HTML backend | **docling.rs extension — no docling backend to compare against**; embedded images resolved by `Content-Location`/`cid:` |

Shared OOXML infrastructure (`ooxml.rs`): a `zip` reader, `.rels` parsing, part
content-type resolution, and image extraction — reused by DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/EPUB.

### ML formats — `docling-pdf`

These run docling's *discriminative* PDF pipeline ported to ONNX. They are now
measured **byte-for-byte against live docling** (the committed PDF groundtruth is
regenerated from it): **5 / 14 exact (6 / 14 whitespace-normalized)**, the rest
close — see `PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`. A deterministic snapshot baseline
(`scripts/conformance/pdf_conformance.sh`) still guards against regressions.

| Format | How |
|---|---|
| PDF | **pure-Rust text parser** (`textparse.rs`, font-advance glyph boxes) + pdfium page render → RT-DETR layout (ONNX) → **TableFormer** table structure (ONNX) → PP-OCRv3 OCR for scanned pages → **docling-parse line sanitizer** (`dp_lines.rs`) + reading-order assembly |
| Images (tiff/webp/png/jpeg) | the same pipeline, image as a single page |
| METS / Google Books | `.tar.gz` of per-page hOCR + TIFF → cells from hOCR → the same layout+assembly path (no OCR needed) |
| Audio (wav/mp3/flac/ogg/aac/m4a + mp4/mov audio tracks) | `docling-asr`: **symphonia** decode (no ffmpeg) → 16 kHz mono → ported log-mel front-end → **Whisper tiny** encoder/decoder (ONNX, greedy with OpenAI's timestamp rules — docling's ASR defaults) → `[time: start-end] text` paragraphs. AVI is the one container symphonia can't demux. |

### DocLang (`.dclx`) coverage

The `.dclx` DocLang output (§3) is scored against docling's own `.dclx` archives
with `scripts/conformance/dclx_conformance.sh` — the extracted `document.xml`
line-diffed, similarity `= 100·(1 − difflines / max_lines)`. **≈92% mean over the
134-fixture non-PDF corpus** (issue #32 target: ≥90%), per source format:

| Format | `.dclx` similarity | Format | `.dclx` similarity |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSV / AsciiDoc / Email | **100%** | Markdown | 92% |
| XLSX | **100%** | ODF / LaTeX | 91% |
| USPTO | 98% | HTML | 84% |
| DOCX / PPTX | 96% | WebVTT | 81% |
| JATS | 95% | | |

This effort was tracked as
[issue #32](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/32) — **closed,
both targets met** (non-PDF ≥90%: 91%; PDF ≥50%: 63% at ±2). Its children
(#38–#41, #44, all closed) landed the ODF, USPTO legacy-entity, elife XML,
wiki_duck and APS-plain-text work — `pftaps` is byte-exact (§5). The PDF path
emits full layout `<location>` provenance (text, headings, tables, pictures,
list items, code, and page-header/footer furniture), scored against a
16-fixture DocLang groundtruth with a ±2-grid-unit geometry tolerance —
**63% mean** (§3, `PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`); the residual is model-level
(TableFormer OTSL structure, layout classification — the closed-as-model-level
blockers of `PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`), not serialization.

---

## 3. Output formats

| Output | API / CLI | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown (legacy)** | `export_to_markdown()` / default | byte-for-byte docling, quirks included |
| **Markdown (strict)** | `.strict(true)` / `--strict` | Rust-only cleaner mode — **no docling equivalent** |
| **JSON** | `export_to_json()` / `--to json` | docling-core native wire format (schema 1.10.0) |
| **DocLang (`.dclx`)** | `export_to_doclang()` · `docling::dclx::save_as_dclx()` / `--to dclx` | DocLang 0.7 XML (`<doclang>`), and the OPC archive docling 2.110's `save_as_doclang()` writes |
| **Image extraction** | `export_to_markdown_with_images(mode, dir)` / `--images` | `placeholder` (default) · `embedded` (base64 data URI) · `referenced` (writes PNG files) |

- **DocLang** reproduces docling-core's `DocLangDocSerializer` (`minidom.toprettyxml`
  layout) directly: headings, rich inline runs (`<bold>`/`<italic>`/`<underline>`/
  `<strikethrough>`/`<sub|superscript>`), lists with enumeration `<marker>`s, OTSL
  tables (`<ched>`/`<fcel>`/`<lcel>`…) with per-cell `<location>`, code, formulas,
  pictures and furniture. Conformance is scored against docling's own `.dclx`
  archives (`scripts/conformance/dclx_conformance.sh`): **≈92% mean similarity over
  the 134-fixture non-PDF corpus** (issue #32's ≥90% target) — csv/asciidoc/email/xlsx
  exact, uspto/docx/pptx/jats in the mid-to-high 90s, md/odf/latex low 90s,
  html/webvtt in the 80s (full table in §2). The format-by-format work was
  tracked as [issue #32](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/32) and its
  children (#38–#41, #44) — all closed, targets met. This is an **output** format;
  a DocLang *input* backend is still out of scope (§5). For **PDF**, where the
  reference `<location>` geometry comes from docling's own layout run, the metric
  is scored with a ±2-grid-unit geometry tolerance (text/structure still
  byte-exact): **52% exact · 63% at ±2** (against the ≥50% target); the remaining
  gap is model-level (TableFormer/layout/reading order), not serialization — see
  [`PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`](./PDF_CONFORMANCE.md).

- **JSON** rebuilds docling's full `body`-tree-of-`$ref`s model from the `Node`
  tree (texts/groups/tables/pictures, labels, list grouping, table grids,
  formula/code items, picture `ImageRef`s). It loads back into Python
  docling-core and **~91% round-trips** byte-identically to the direct Markdown.
- **Image extraction** is wired for PDF/image (figure-region crops) and DOCX/PPTX
  (embedded blobs) by default, and — opt-in via
  `DocumentConverter::fetch_images` (`--fetch-images`) — for HTML/EPUB `<img src>`:
  `data:` URIs, local files (relative to the source), remote `http(s)` URLs, and
  EPUB archive entries. Off by default, matching docling's `enable_*_fetch=False`.
  JSON always embeds extracted images as data URIs.

---

## 4. Differences from upstream docling

These are deliberate or unavoidable divergences, not bugs.

1. **Simplified document model.** `docling.rs`'s `Node` enum
   (`Heading`/`Paragraph`/`ListItem`/`Code`/`Table`/`Picture`/`Group`) is flatter
   than docling-core's `DocItem` graph. JSON export *reconstructs* the full
   `$ref` wire format from it; JSON input maps the other way.

2. **Inline formatting is baked into text.** Bold/italic/links/inline-math are
   stored as Markdown markers inside the text string, where docling keeps
   structured `formatting`/`hyperlink` fields. Consequence: for those spans the
   exported JSON carries the *rendered* text rather than structured fields, and
   ~9% of JSON→Markdown round-trips differ (URLs/`&`/`_` re-escaped by docling).

3. **`strict` Markdown mode is Rust-only.** Default output reproduces docling's
   legacy quirks (`***x*** .` run-spacing, dropped code-fence languages, `\_` and
   entity re-escaping); `strict` produces cleaner Markdown. docling has no such
   switch. All conformance numbers are measured in **legacy** mode.

4. **Tables use docling-core's padded GitHub format.** All backends emit the
   width-padded `tabulate(tablefmt="github")` tables that current published
   docling produces (columns padded to header-width+2 or the widest data cell,
   numeric columns right-aligned). The PDF groundtruth was regenerated from live
   docling to match. (An earlier compact `| - |` variant — to match a stale
   committed corpus — was reverted; the `compact_tables` option still exists but
   no backend sets it.)

5. **The PDF pipeline is discriminative and byte-measured.** Ported from
   docling's standard pipeline:
   - **Layout** — RT-DETR (`docling-layout-heron`) exported to ONNX, run via
     `ort`. Same model family as docling.
   - **OCR** — PP-OCRv3 recognition (RapidOCR) via ONNX, *not* docling's default
     EasyOCR; different recognizer → different scanned text.
   - **Tables** — **TableFormer** (image encoder + autoregressive OTSL structure
     decoder + cell-bbox decoder, ported to ONNX), on a cv2-exact preprocessed
     crop. Reproduces docling's padded GitHub tables — `2305-pg9` is cell-for-cell
     exact; multi-row headers / spans on the dense papers still differ.
   - **Text** — a **pure-Rust PDF text parser** (`textparse.rs`, on `lopdf`)
     reconstructs glyph boxes from font advance widths + the text/graphics matrices
     (matching docling-parse's geometry, not pdfium's rendered boxes); handles
     Type0/CID + simple fonts, ToUnicode/encodings, Form XObject recursion, a
     glyph-name fallback, and overprint dedup. It is the default text layer
     (`DOCLING_PDFIUM_TEXT=1` falls back to pdfium). Its cells feed a port of
     docling-parse's line sanitizer (`dp_lines.rs`): 3-pass corner-distance
     contraction with gap-proportional space insertion, `enforce_same_font`,
     ligature recomposition, loose-box geometry. Plus docling's markdown escaping,
     docling-parse's typographic-punctuation table (every curly quote → `'`),
     wrap dehyphenation, paragraph-continuation merging, docling's rule-based
     reading-order predictor with cluster cells joined in docling-parse index
     order, and false-picture / page-number layout fixes. The parser is now the **sole** text
     source — pdfium does only page rasterisation + link annotations. Its per-word
     cells reproduce docling-parse's `word_cells` byte-for-byte (377/377 on
     `2305-pg9`), which is what TableFormer matches against; a char-frequency
     validator (`scripts/test/parser_completeness.py`) confirms nothing is silently
     dropped (Form-XObject text and glyph-name-only fonts were the two classes it
     surfaced and fixed).
   - Output is measured **byte-for-byte against live docling** (PDF_CONFORMANCE.md):
     **5 / 14 exact, 6 / 14 whitespace-normalized**, the rest close. The remaining
     gaps are model-level (TableFormer structure on complex tables, layout
     classification, title-page reading order) plus `amt`'s fraction spacing — a
     docling quirk from its embedded-font OS/2 metrics that our single-spaced output
     renders more faithfully; matching it exactly needs a font-metrics layer that
     entangles with the RTL box geometry. The full per-fixture breakdown and the
     model-level blockers live in `PDF_CONFORMANCE.md`.

6. **Extracted image bytes are real but not byte-identical.** Cropped/embedded
   pixels are correct, but the PNG re-encoding differs from docling's, so the
   base64 in `embedded` mode / JSON `ImageRef`s won't match byte-for-byte.

7. **XML format detection sniffs content.** JATS, USPTO and XBRL all use `.xml`;
   the converter routes by content markers (`us-patent` → USPTO, `us-gaap`/`dei`
   → XBRL, else JATS) rather than the extension alone.

8. **Headless-browser pass is opt-in.** Form key-value regions, inline
   visibility, and nested-table cell flattening (docling's exact spacing) are
   all handled statically by default — no browser. Only stylesheet-driven
   (CSS-cascade) visibility suppression needs a rendered page, available behind
   the optional `web-browser` feature / `--use-web-browser` flag (Rust-driven
   Chromium) — see §5.

---

## 5. Not migrated / out of scope

Nothing here blocks day-to-day conversion: every remaining item is either a
deliberate scope boundary or a cosmetic, single-fixture polish gap.

**Out of scope by design:**

- **VLM pipelines** (SmolDocling / remote VLM) and **enrichment models** (picture
  classification, formula understanding, code understanding). Model-bound; out of
  scope for the discriminative port. (**Audio/ASR is now done** — see §2; the
  only container gap is AVI, which symphonia cannot demux.)
- **XML DocLang / DocTags *input* backend** — DocLang is supported as an
  **output** format (§3), but reading `.dclx`/DocTags *back in* is not: no such
  sources in the corpus to verify against, and not in the requested scope.

**Now migrated (previously listed here):**

- **DOCX grouped/anchored drawings and floating text frames.** Blip-less
  DrawingML shapes yield docling's one-rendered-picture-per-paragraph as a
  placeholder (docling rasterizes them through LibreOffice; the Markdown
  placeholder is identical without rendering), pictures are emitted for
  heading/list/checkbox paragraphs too, and the textbox de-duplication matches
  docling's per-paragraph scope — `drawingml` and `textbox` are exact,
  **DOCX is 26/26**.

- **Legacy APS-text patents.** USPTO covers the modern `v4x` XML, the 2001-era
  `pap-v15` applications (`pa`) and `PATDOC`/ST.32 grants (`pg`) with their CALS
  tables, **and** the legacy **APS plain text** (`pftaps`): docling routes it to
  its plain-text backend (one DocLang `<text>` dump), and docling.rs reproduces
  that serialization byte-exactly — the `.dclx` is a perfect match
  ([issue #44](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/44), done).

**Minor known gaps (cosmetic, tracked per-fixture):**

- **ODF presentation/chart frames** — slide-title heading detection, free
  shape-text extraction and the speaker-notes drop on `.odp` slides, and `.odt`
  chart/embedded-object frames (`text_document_02`). Everything else on ODF is
  done: mixed-style list continuation, empty-list-item level collapse, ODS
  sheet→table region detection with numeric alignment, and rich table cells.
- **`wiki_duck` offline rendering.** The HTML subsystem itself is complete
  (31/32 exact): key-value form regions, docling-faithful inline-image
  handling, inline visibility suppression, deep nested-table cell flattening
  with docling's exact spacing (which turned out to be BeautifulSoup whitespace
  semantics, not rendered geometry — pure Rust, no browser needed), and —
  behind the optional `web-browser` feature / `--use-web-browser` flag —
  CSS-cascade visibility suppression via Rust-driven Chromium. The one fixture
  still short of exact is `wiki_duck`, whose collapsed menus are hidden by
  external, host-relative stylesheets: resolving them requires those
  stylesheets to be fetchable at render time (`--use-web-browser` with network
  access), which a fully-offline conversion inherently cannot do.


---

## 6. Extensions

- **`docling-rag`** — documents → chunking → embeddings → vector search,
  with swappable embedders (Ollama/Gemini/local ONNX), stores
  (SQLite+sqlite-vec / PostgreSQL+pgvector), LLM, sources and queues, plus an
  eval harness and a REST API. See the crate README.
- **`docling-node`** — Node.js/Bun N-API bindings (npm package).
- **`docling-py`** — PyO3 bindings (PyPI package `docling-rs`): a strangler-fig
  drop-in for docling's Python API where the Rust engine is the document
  processor and `result.document` is a genuine `docling_core` `DoclingDocument`,
  so its `export_to_markdown()` / `export_to_dict()` / chunkers are docling's
  own code.
- **MHTML backend** — no docling analogue.

## 7. Testing

- **`cargo test`** — unit tests per backend/serializer **plus an output-
  regression suite** (`crates/docling/tests/regression.rs`): every
  declarative source under `crates/docling/tests/data/<fmt>/sources/` is
  converted to legacy Markdown, strict Markdown and docling JSON and compared to
  committed fixtures (133 sources × 3). `DOCLING_RS_REGEN=1` refreshes them.
  The JSON fixtures double as a docling-core load check.
- **Snapshot harness** — `scripts/conformance/pdf_conformance.sh` regenerates and diffs the
  PDF/image/METS baseline (needs pdfium + the ONNX models; **91/91 exact**).
- **Conformance** — `scripts/conformance/conformance.sh <fmt>` scores a format against the
  latest published docling (installed from PyPI; see
  [`COMPARING.md`](./COMPARING.md)).
- **Differential / perf** — `scripts/conformance/compare.sh`, `scripts/test/performance.sh`.
  The PDF pipeline's profiling data, the INT8/SIMD optimization results
  (4.3× warm vs Python docling on the ML pipeline), and the remaining
  performance backlog live in [`PDF_PERFORMANCE.md`](./PDF_PERFORMANCE.md).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) gates every pull request and master push on
`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and
`cargo test` (the fast pure-Rust suite — no model downloads). fmt/clippy run on a
**pinned** toolchain (`LINT_TOOLCHAIN` in the workflow) so a new stable can't fail
CI on unrelated commits; tests run on current `stable`. On master it then runs
`scripts/ci/release.sh`: it derives the next version from the conventional-commit
messages since the last `v*` tag (`feat:` → minor, `fix:`/`perf:` → patch, a
`type!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE` → major; docs/chore/ci/etc → no release), bumps the
workspace version, commits + tags it (with `[skip ci]`, via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so it
doesn't loop), and publishes the crates with `scripts/ci/ci_publish.sh` in
dependency order — skipping any version already on crates.io.

---

## 8. Goals & design rules (unchanged)

- A tiny, obvious public API — one `DocumentConverter`, one `convert`, one
  `DoclingDocument` you can `export_to_markdown()` / `export_to_json()`.
- Dependency-light pure-Rust parsing for everything that isn't ML.
- Output byte-compatible with docling-core's serializers where it reasonably can
  be, so the port is a drop-in for downstream Markdown/JSON consumers.
- The ML stack is *not* reimplemented in PyTorch-equivalent Rust; it is
  quarantined behind ONNX (`ort`) inference in `docling-pdf`.

---

## 9. Keeping up with upstream docling

The port is built to be *measured against* upstream rather than merely
inspired by it, which makes tracking new docling releases a mechanical
process instead of a guess:

1. **Detect drift.** `scripts/conformance/conformance.sh <fmt>` installs the **latest
   published docling from PyPI** into an isolated venv and byte-diffs both
   engines' Markdown over the committed corpus, per fixture. An upstream
   release that changes output (a serializer tweak, a new label, a model
   bump) shows up as a concrete per-fixture diff — not as silent divergence.
   `scripts/conformance/compare.sh` does the same for a single ad-hoc document.
2. **Classify each diff.** Either upstream changed *serialization/logic* —
   port the change to the matching backend/serializer (the crate layout in §1
   maps one-to-one to docling's modules, so the port target is usually
   obvious) — or upstream shipped *new models*, in which case
   `scripts/install/export_layout.py` / `export_tableformer.py` re-export the new
   checkpoints to ONNX, `scripts/install/quantize_models.py` re-quantizes, and
   `.github/workflows/publish-models.yml` republishes the model release
   (bump the tag when the export itself changes).
3. **Re-gate.** `scripts/conformance/pdf_conformance.sh` (deterministic snapshot baseline)
   plus the 133-source regression suite in `cargo test` confirm nothing else
   moved. The committed PDF groundtruth is regenerated from live docling
   (`scripts/conformance/pdf_groundtruth.sh`) whenever upstream output legitimately
   changes, so "exact" always means *exact against current docling*.
4. **New formats/features** follow the same recipe the existing 20 formats
   did: a backend module + fixtures + conformance scoring, tracked in §2.

What this cannot absorb automatically: upstream features that need new model
*architectures* (VLM pipeline, enrichment models — out of scope per §5) and
places where the document models intentionally differ (§4). Those are
documented divergences rather than drift.

## Appendix — original phased plan (history)

The port followed roughly: **Phase 0** skeleton & API → **Phase 2** text/markup
(Markdown, CSV, HTML, AsciiDoc, DeepSeek) → **Phase 3** Office & e-book (DOCX,
PPTX, XLSX, EPUB, ODF) → **Phase 4** long tail (XML families, LaTeX, Email,
WebVTT, JSON) → **Phase 5–6** the PDF/image ML pipeline (pdfium + ONNX layout/OCR
+ geometric tables) → output formats (strict Markdown, JSON, image extraction) →
**Phase 7** audio/ASR (symphonia + ONNX Whisper). The Node.js/Bun (`docling-node`)
and Python (`docling-py`, PyO3) interop bindings followed.

## The meat-grinder mascot 🦀

The mascot — a duck feeding a document into a meat grinder
([`docs/assets/logo.svg`](./docs/assets/logo.svg)) — captures what this does: a
grinder is the machine you push anything through to get a single, uniform mince,
which is exactly what happens to documents here — PDF, DOCX, HTML, XLSX … all
come out as one `DoclingDocument`. And it's written in Rust, so Ferris the crab
🦀 still gets a seat.
